Instacart is the company that half of American households use to get groceries from their favorite grocery stores like Costco, Wegman’s, Wallmart, Whole Foods, Petco, and more without even leaving the house. Whether you shop from meticulously planned grocery lists or shop just for the heck of it, our unique food rituals define who we are. Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you. Instacart’s data science team plays a big part in providing this delightful shopping experience. Currently they use transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. Recently, Instacart open sourced this data - see their blog post on 3 Million Instacart Orders, Open Sourced.  Instacart currently uses XGBoost, word2vec and Annoy in production on similar data to sort items for users to “buy again”:  Context: Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/overview
